					<b>We offer a wide variety of services to suit all needs. We specialize in move-in cleanings, move-out cleanings, 
					and even renovation clean up.  We do not charge an hourly rate in order 
					to put forth our best offer because we know some projects take longer than others.


					<h2>What we do:</br>
					</br>
					We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly cleanings at a flat rate.</h2>
