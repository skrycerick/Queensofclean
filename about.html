					<h1>About the <span>Queens of Clean</span></h1>
					<span>So, what's to love about us?</span>
					<p>We are three women that are longtime residents in Dutchess County.  You will be getting locally working women instead of
					big corporate cleaning businesses.  We all come from families with children so we know how messy the house can get.
					That's why we charge one flat rate instead of charging by the hour.</p>
					<span>What makes you better than other cleaning companies?</span>
					<p>We are a small business comprised of only three women.  Why is this important? We love being able to meet one on
					one with our clients to ensure they are receiving the best service possible.  We use only the best cleaning products 
					leaving your space place spic and span.</p>
					<span>Where do we work?</span>
					<p>As we mentioned before, we are a locally run business.  That being said, we currently service houses in the Dutchess 
					County area.  We are looking to expand our services in the near future.  This smaller area range allows us to 
					arrive faster if cleaning services are needed last minute.</p>
					<span>What else do we do?</span>
					<p>On top of making your space spotless, we also offer organizational services.  Whether you need cleaning or organizing 
					done, we can provide you with a free estimate.</p>
